# Maze Game

Welcome to the Maze Game project! This Python and Pygame-based game challenges players to navigate through a maze, avoiding collisions with walls and reaching the end to progress to the next level.

## Features
- **Multiple Levels:** Test your maze-solving skills with progressively challenging levels.
- **Collision Detection:** Avoid running into maze walls to successfully complete each level.
- **End Goal:** Reach the designated endpoint to unlock the next level.

## How to Play
- Use the arrow keys to navigate through the maze.
- Successfully reach the end point to advance to the next level.
- Beware of collisions with maze walls; they'll reset your progress.

## How to Run
1. Install Python and Pygame.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run the game script using `python maze_game.py`.

Feel free to explore, modify, and use this project as a foundation for creating your maze-based games or learning about game development with Pygame.

Happy navigating!
